I have had error with some tests which failed randomly. 

Topic were thread issues. We have been tackling them one by one. They seem fixed but left me with a sense of uncertainty

Perform the following tasks

1) Inspect ALL tests and verify that they are deterministic and cannot fail due to race conditions or other threading issues.  Report in the file TEST_ANALYSIS.md

2) Determine whether the threading issues in the tests might imply possible bugs in the app itself

3) if any issues are found, also give possible ways to addres these

4) In any case: DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE!
