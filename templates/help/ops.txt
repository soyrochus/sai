Helper operations that do not invoke the LLM:

- `--init` writes a starter config.yaml with placeholder AI credentials and
  standard Unix tools (grep, find, awk, sed, etc.) pre-configured.
- `--create-prompt <command> [path]` writes a per-call prompt template.
- `--add-prompt PATH` merges additional tools from PATH into the global default
  prompt, resolving conflicts interactively when a TTY is available.
- `--list-tools [PATH]` prints tools from the global config and optionally a
  prompt file, marking which ones are on PATH.

Examples:
  sai --init
  sai --add-prompt prompts/git-safe.yml      # Add git tools
  sai --add-prompt prompts/data-focussed-tool.yml  # Add jq, yq, csvkit
  sai --list-tools

The standard tools are already included by --init. Use --add-prompt to extend
with specialized toolsets like git or data processing tools. `--create-prompt`
is handy for building a one-off prompt file that you can refine before merging
into your defaults.
