sai-cli records each invocation as NDJSON in a history log with timestamp, cwd,
argv, generated command, flags, and notes.

Log locations:
- Linux: ~/.config/sai/history.log
- macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/sai/history.log
- Windows: %APPDATA%/sai/history.log

Files rotate around 1 MB, keeping one backup. `--analyze` reads this log.
You can inspect it directly for auditing or troubleshooting, and copy entries
to share commands without re-running them.
