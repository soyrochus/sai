--unsafe keeps the tool whitelist but disables operator blocking so pipes,
redirects, substitution, and chaining are allowed. It always forces a prompt
before execution. Pair it with `--explain` when you want extra clarity.

Use --unsafe when a single safe command is impossible; prefer explicit tools,
scopes, and confirm/explain first.
