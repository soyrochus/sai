Prompt packages ship under prompts/ so you can start quickly or extend them
beyond the default tools bundled by `sai --init`:

- prompts/data-focussed-tool.yml     Data-centric tools (jq, yq, csvkit, mlr, ...)
- prompts/safe-destructive-tools.yml Destructive-capable tools with guardrails
- prompts/git-safe.yml               Read-only git operations
- prompts/git-full.yml               Full git workflows (confirm strongly advised)

Use them directly: `sai prompts/data-focussed-tool.yml "List json files under logs"`.
Copy and edit to suit your environment or merge with `--add-prompt`.
