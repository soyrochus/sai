--analyze reads the most recent history entry and asks the LLM to explain what
likely happened, why it succeeded or failed, and what to try next. It never
executes commands and cannot be combined with other options or prompts.

Run it after an error or surprising output to get guidance. Pair with history
inspection if you want to review older invocations manually.
