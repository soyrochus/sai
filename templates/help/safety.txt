Safety in sai-cli has four layers:

1) Tool whitelist: commands may only use tools defined in the active prompt.
2) Operator blocking: default mode rejects pipes, redirects, &&, ||, and subshells.
3) Confirmation: `-c/--confirm` asks before running; `--unsafe` and `--explain`
   always imply confirmation.
4) Tool-level force_explain: individual tools can require explanation mode via
   the 'force_explain' configuration field, providing an additional safety layer
   for destructive or complex operations.

Commands are executed directly (no implicit `/bin/sh -c`). `--explain` and
`--analyze` are read-only operations that never run shell commands. Use
`--unsafe` sparingly when you intentionally need operators.

Tool-Level Force Explain:
Configure tools to automatically trigger --explain behavior:

  tools:
    - name: rm
      force_explain: true
      config: ...

When a command uses this tool, you'll get an explanation and confirmation
even without specifying --explain. This defense-in-depth approach protects
against accidental data loss while maintaining explicit user control.

If a generated command surprises you, re-run with `--explain` to see a summary,
or `--analyze` to review the last invocation from history before trying again.
