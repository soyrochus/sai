--peek sends truncated sample data to the LLM for schema inference. Each file is
read up to an internal byte limit and clearly marked as sample data. Use it to
show record layout, not to process full datasets. Multiple --peek flags are
allowed to provide several examples.

Only include files you are comfortable sending to the provider. Avoid secrets,
tokens, or large proprietary dumps; peek is for structure, not content upload.
